# An Overview of GDNative

GDNative is the interface between the Godot engine version 3 and bindings in native languages, such as C, C++ or Rust.

This chapter gives a broad overview of basic GDNative concepts and godot-rust's approach to implement them in Rust. It is not a usage guide for exposing your Rust code to Godot; see chapter [Binding to Rust code](rust-binding.md) for concrete examples.

Subchapters:

1. [Data representations](data-representations.md)
1. [`Ref`, `TRef` and `Instance`](wrappers.md)
1. [Game architecture](architecture.md)
