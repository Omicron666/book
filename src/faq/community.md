## I need help, where can I ask?

The godot-rust project uses several sources for different kinds of information.

### 1 - API documentation

The documentation of released crates is hosted at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/gdnative). 
If you prefer to look up API details of the latest `master` in-development version, they are hosted on [GitHub pages](https://godot-rust.github.io/docs/gdnative/).

The crate-level documentation of `gdnative` should guide you to more concrete places to look at.
If you don't know where to start, look at the `prelude` module -- it contains the most commonly used symbols.

### 2 - Godot Docs

As godot-rust is the layer that wraps the [Godot API](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html), the behavior and use cases for many of the classes and methods are available in the official Godot documentation. Whenever you have questions for anything Godot-specific that is outside godot-rust's scope, this is the place to go as well.

### 3 - Discord Server

For more complex questions, the fastest way to get an answer is to reach out to us and fellow developers on the [godot-rust Discord](https://discord.gg/aKUCJ8rJsc).

### 4 - Bug reports: GitHub issue

If you find a bug or an issue with the godot-rust bindings or have an idea for future development, please feel free to open up a GitHub issue and we'd be happy to take a look.

Please consider the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you plan to contribute.

GitHub issues are not intended for general questions, as only project maintainers and contributors generally read and track new issues.
As such, if you have a question about how to _use_ the library, we highly recommend seeking out one of the above options before opening an issue.
