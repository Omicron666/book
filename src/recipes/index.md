# Recipes

This is a small collection of recipes and patterns that various contributors have found to be useful with godot-rust.

These recipes cover general use cases and are not intended to be the *only* way to implement these patterns. Each recipe should be evaluated and customized to your specific use case.

The pages are listed alphabetically, so instead of reading them one-by-one, you can directly jump to those that appeal to you.
